Privilege escalation refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in a system to gain higher levels of access or privileges than intended by the system administrator. There are two main types of privilege escalation: vertical privilege escalation and horizontal privilege escalation.

Vertical Privilege Escalation:

Vertical privilege escalation involves gaining higher levels of access within the same level of privilege, typically from a standard user to an administrator or root user.
This type of privilege escalation often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in software or misconfigurations in the operating system.
Common techniques for vertical privilege escalation include exploiting buffer overflows, insecure file permissions, or weaknesses in service configurations.
Once an attacker gains higher privileges, they can perform actions that are typically restricted to privileged users, such as modifying system files, installing malware, or creating new user accounts.
Horizontal Privilege Escalation:

Horizontal privilege escalation involves gaining the same level of privilege but on a different system or account.
This type of privilege escalation typically occurs in multi-user systems where users have similar privileges.
Common techniques for horizontal privilege escalation include password guessing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting trust relationships between systems.
Once an attacker gains access to another user's account or system, they can use it to further their attack, escalate privileges vertically, or move laterally within the network.
Both vertical and horizontal privilege escalation are significant security concerns and can lead to severe consequences if exploited by attackers. System administrators must regularly update and patch their systems, enforce the principle of least privilege, and implement security measures such as access controls and monitoring to mitigate the risk of privilege escalation attacks. Additionally, organizations should conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
